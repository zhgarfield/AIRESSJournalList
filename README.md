# AIRESS Behavioral Science Journal Analysis

**Author:** Zachary H. Garfield  
**Institution:** UM6P – AIRESS  
**Repository:** <https://github.com/zhgarfield/AIRESSJournalList>

## Overview

This repository contains a fully reproducible workflow for constructing a transparent, data-driven classification of academic journals relevant to the interdisciplinary Behavioral Sciences at AIRESS (UM6P).

The project integrates bibliometric data from Scopus (2024), applies dimensionality-reduction to extract a unified “impact” measure, and uses clustering to produce a defensible tiering system:

- **A: Excellent**  
- **B: Preferred**  
- **C: Acceptable**  
- **Avoid** (automatically excluded as low-impact)

The resulting resource supports publication decisions, research evaluation, student mentoring, and institutional planning.

## Data Sources

We use Scopus 2024 source listings from subject areas most relevant to behavioral science, including:

- Anthropology  
- Psychology (General, Applied, Cognitive, Developmental, Social)  
- Decision Sciences  
- Cultural Studies  
- Sociology and Political Science  
- Demography  
- Health (Social Science)  
- Multidisciplinary

Each Scopus file includes:

- **CiteScore**  
- **SNIP (Source Normalized Impact per Paper)**  
- **SJR (SCImago Journal Rank)**  
- **Publisher and metadata**

Two epidemiological policy outlets (MMWR Surveillance Summaries and MMWR Recommendations and Reports) were removed, since they fall far outside the domain of behavioral science research.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Import and Cleaning

All Scopus files are read, tagged with a subject-area, merged, and deduplicated. Core citation metrics are converted to numeric values, and journals with missing values are dropped.

### 2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is applied to the three standardized metrics:

- CiteScore  
- SNIP  
- SJR  

PC1 captures ~88% of total variance and represents a unified **impact dimension**.  
The axis is oriented so that higher PC1 corresponds to higher impact.

### 3. Construction of the Impact Index

PC1 is rescaled to an intuitive **0–100 Impact Index**, where:

- **0 = extremely low-impact**
- **100 = highest-impact journal in the dataset**

The lowest quartile of journals (very low impact) is removed prior to tiering.

### 4. K-means Clustering and Tier Assignment

A k-means model with **k = 3** identifies natural journal groupings within the Impact Index.

Clusters are ordered by mean impact and assigned:

1. **A: Excellent**  
2. **B: Preferred**  
3. **C: Acceptable**

Journals removed earlier are assigned to **Avoid**.
